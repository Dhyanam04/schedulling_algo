# CPU scheduller
Here i have made programs in c language that modifies the html file according to the schedulling algorithm used and displays the gantt chart<br><br>
Here the main.c file is the main file which implements the program and various schedulling algos it uses the other c files as header files and various functions from that header files are implemented when called<br>
and other important file in this is temp.html it is an html file that displays the gantt chart on web<br><br>
<br>I have used fprintf and fscanf commands i plan to make a seperate file for this 
The cells/tabs on the webpage below the Gantt chart display the time in seconds that has passed i plan to add javascript and css more effectively in this 
<br>ps: I don't know why i named it temp.html :|
